   RIPE Atlas Interface Hackathon
        May 21th - 22th, 2016
         Copenhagen, Denmark

These scripts is an attempt to visualize a a dual stack traceroute on a map.

Out of 15k dual-stack probe-to-probe traceroutes performed, only ~15, had more than 50% coverage
in GeoIPMap.

Future work
-----------

Future work includes using the existing location information, to extract city-level location information,
about neighbouring routes.
